## Qovery bot self host
- Yes,if you want to self host and customize the qovery bot,these files will work
- So,I'd recommend using [qovery](https://qovery.com) to host the bot for better performance and it's user friendly.
- If you're confused in using and editing code by yourself and hosting the bot on qovery, I already made a [tutorial](https://github.com/jiopolm/discordjs-qovery#deploying-simple-discordjs-bot-to-qoveryweb-console-for-free) on hosting an sample discord.js bot to Qovery.
